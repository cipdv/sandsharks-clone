      <p>
        Toronto Sandsharks is a volunteer run, non-profit driven group of LGBTQ+
        people who call themselves beach volleyball players. We've been playing
        as a group at Ashbridges Bay in Toronto since 1998.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>We operate solely by volunteers and donations from our members.</p>

      <h1 className="mt-8 mb-8 text-2xl">Who is welcome to join?</h1>
      <p>
        Anyone and everyone!{" "}
        <b>
          The group is geared towards providing a safe and fun atmosphere for
          LGBTQ+ adults and allies.
        </b>{" "}
        All genders, backgrounds, ages (typically 18+ is encouraged), and
        athletic abilities are welcome to come give it a try.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Weâ€™ll do our best to pair you up with others around your skill level;
        we've had members who have played high school, university, college,
        professional and national level volleyball, and people who have never
        touched a volleyball before. Most people are somewhere in between.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We play 2v2 beach volleyball. Most of the skills from indoor volleyball
        are the same, though the gameplay can be a bit different, so we offer
        free clinics most weekends for new players who want to learn how to play
        the game.

        in the Toronto Beaches. This is a public beach, so please do your best
        to familiarize yourself with and follow the rules of the beach so that
        we keep our good reputation with all beach goers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There is paid parking available at the park, and lots of places to lock
        up bikes. The Lakeshore bike path will take you right there!

      <h1 className="mt-8 mb-8 text-2xl">When do we play?</h1>
      <p className="mt-2">
        We gather to play on most weekends throughout the Summer. Our season
        usually starts around early-May and runs until the end of September. Our
        schedule is posted in the members section of this website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        All games are drop-in, so you can join us anytime we're playing and play
        as many games as you like!

        We ask all members to consider making a donation. Donations are
        pay-what-you-can, with a suggested amount of $40/player for the entire
        season to help cover the cost of court rentals, storage, and replacing
        worn out equipment.
